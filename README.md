# TheWasteFoodProject
This project aims to make the donation process, quick and convenient. It brings the Food Donors and the Food Takers (FNUs) closer through this website. This project makes the food donation process super easy by connecting the food donors to all those food needing institutions in Karachi. Now, one can easily donate their leftover food to NGOs by simply posting on this website. When a post is added on our website, all the FNUs receive a text message about your leftover food. The FNU nearest to your home will contact you and will pick up the food. The process of posting on our website takes less than a minute, that makes the donation process easy.
